# PT Sans Webfont Kit

Webfont kit for [PT Sans](http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/PT-Sans).

Each typeface is split into a separate Less partial, so it's easy to choose the typefaces you need and leave the rest out.

Compiled and minified CSS is also available.

Installable via [Bower](http://bower.io):

    bower install pt-sans
